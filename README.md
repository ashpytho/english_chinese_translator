# english_chinese_translator
I have put a very few regular english sentences that can be translated into chinese 
The sentences that one can convert are:
 'And you?',
 'Good evening',
 'Good morning',
 'Have you eaten?',
 'Hello',
 'How are you?',
 'I ate',
 'Iâ€™m fine',
 'Welcome'
 
 What you can do?
 1.Add more english sentences with their chinese translations.
 2.Add english and chinese lists to a json file and import whenever necessary.
